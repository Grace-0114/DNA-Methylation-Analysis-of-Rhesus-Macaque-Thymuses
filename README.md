# DNA-Methylation-Analysis-of-Rhesus-Macaque-Thymuses
This study analyzed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing data of  rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to characterize the genomic DNA methylation profile of the thymus and explore the molecular mechanism of age-related changes in the thymus.
